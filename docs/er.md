## Product vision

GameOn is committed to revolutionizing the online gaming landscape by creating a dynamic, unified platform that fosters collaboration, encourages knowledge-sharing, and celebrates gamers' contributions. In a world where information fragmentation and community engagement challenges persist, GameOn aims to be the go-to destination for gamers seeking connection and recognition within the gaming ecosystem.

## A1: GameOn

GameOn is being developed in response to the dynamic landscape of online gaming communities, which serve as the lifeblood of the gaming experience, where players congregate to share insights, strategies, and experiences. As the challenges of information fragmentation and community engagement continue to endure in the present, our system seeks to provide a unified platform that encourages collaboration, facilitates knowledge-sharing, and offers recognition for gamers' valuable contributions.

The main goal of the project is to cultivate a thriving gaming community by providing a platform where gamers can connect, share experiences, and engage with one another, while also creating a reliable and comprehensive source of gaming information that encompasses questions, answers, and expert insights. Additionally, we aim to recognize and reward gamers for their valuable contributions, enhancing motivation and participation within the community.

The website will encompass three distinct user roles, each with its own set of permissions and responsibilities. These will be guest users, authenticated users and administrators.

The **guest users** have the privilege of viewing content posted by other users. They can seamlessly navigate between various page sections, each specially designed for specific sub-communities based on interests or game genres. Furthermore, GameOn offers advanced search features to improve user experience, allowing users to search for posts using tags, as well as by frequency and popularity of posts. When they decide to become members of our community, they can create their profile and transition into authenticated users.

**Authenticated users** have the freedom to post questions, provide answers, comment and vote on existing posts, alongside the ability to view their submitted Q & A’s. Users whose answers receive notable recognition through peer votes may achieve certified user status, progressing through ranks such as Bronze, Gold, and Master. Additionally, they can actively monitor and track their contributions, as badges will be delivered when they accomplish certain tasks or reach specific milestones, encouraging positive behaviors and contributions to the open-source community.  

Lastly, **administrators** bear the responsibility of overseeing system management, with complete access and modification privileges, such as accepting or declining tags, creating new game sections, suspending user accounts, and removing articles that violate established rules. The administration team also has access to user and Q&A statistics, enabling them to monitor platform performance, user engagement, and Q&A effectiveness.

GameOn will feature a responsive design, ensuring users enjoy seamless browsing whether on a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. With intuitive navigation and a superb user interface, it guarantees a delightful experience across all devices.
