### 4. Input Validation

#### 4.1. Server-side validation

We utilized the `Illuminate\Http\Request` functionality, which includes a `validate` function. This function offers various validation methods. We've implemented this feature to ensure that inputs in our forms, such as those for login, registration, and editing posts, undergo proper validation checks. Examples of this can be observed in the code snippets provided below:

```php
/* Validating a request to register a user */
 $request->validate([
    'name' => 'required|string|max:250',
    'username' => 'required|string|unique:users',
    'email' => 'required|email|max:250|unique:users',
    'password' => 'required|min:8|confirmed', 
]);
```

```php
/* Validating a request to create a question */$request->validate([
    'title' => 'required|max:256',
    'content' => 'required',
    'game_id' => 'nullable|exists:game,id'
]);
```

#### 4.2. Client-side validation

For client-side validation, we employed JavaScript to handle input verification directly within the user's browser. This involved using alert messages to prompt users about empty input fields or incorrect data types before they submit a form. Examples of the client-side validation implemented using JavaScript are shown below:

```js
function createGame(){
    event.preventDefault();
    const title = editGamePage.querySelector('#name');
    const description = editGamePage.querySelector('#description');
    if (title.value === ''){
        title.focus();
        createNotificationBox('Empty game title', 'Please enter your game title!', 'warning');
    }
    else if (description.value == '') {
        description.focus();
        createNotificationBox('Empty game description', 'Please enter your game description!', 'warning');
    } else {
        sendAjaxRequest('post', '/api/game', {name: title.value, description: description.value, category_id: category_id}, createGameHandler);
    }
}
```

<img src="../images/js_empty_validation.png" alt="js empty validation">

<br>

```js
const imageExtentions = ["png", "jpeg", "jpg", "gif"];
const documentExtentions = ["doc", "docx", "txt", "pdf"];
const fileExtension = file.name.split('.').pop().toLowerCase();
if (!documentExtentions.includes(fileExtension)) {
    createNotificationBox('Invalid file type!', 'Please choose a valid file type to upload!', 'error');
}        
```

## A10: Presentation

### 1. Product presentation

GameOn is being developed in response to the dynamic landscape of online gaming communities, which serve as the lifeblood of the gaming experience, where players congregate to share insights, strategies, and experiences. The main goal of the project is to cultivate a thriving gaming community by providing a platform where gamers can connect, share experiences, and engage with one another, while also creating a reliable and comprehensive source of gaming information that encompasses questions, answers, and expert insights. The website will encompass three distinct user roles, each with its own set of permissions and responsibilities. These will be guest users, authenticated users and administrators.

**Guest users** can explore content across various genres and specialized sections through an advanced search feature.
**Authenticated users** engage actively by posting questions, providing answers, commenting, and earning recognition and badges based on their contributions and achievements. **Administrators** oversee system management, handling tasks like tag management, content moderation, and monitoring platform performance through user and Q&A statistics. This structure encourages engagement, rewards contributions, and ensures effective platform governance.
